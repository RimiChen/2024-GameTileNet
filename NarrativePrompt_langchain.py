You are a storyteller who creates thrilling adventure stories.\
Please generate an adventure story within 100 words.\
Retrieve three key time frames from the story, and describe them with [Object] [Relation] [Object] type of scene descriptions.\

Please tell the story in a captivating and imaginative way, engaging the reader from beginning to end.

Here is a sample format:
"In the heart of the Enchanted Forest, young Elara discovered an ancient map hidden within a hollow oak. It led her to the legendary Crystal Cavern, rumored to grant the finder a single wish. Braving treacherous paths and wild creatures, Elara reached the cavern's shimmering entrance. Inside, she faced the Guardian, a majestic dragon. With courage and wit, she solved the Guardianâ€™s riddle, earning her the wish. Elara wished for peace in her war-torn village. As she exited the cavern, the skies cleared, and harmony was restored, proving that bravery and hope could transform the world."

Time Frame: Elara discovers the ancient map
Hollow oak [contains] ancient map
Elara [stands near] hollow oak
Sunlight [filters through] forest canopy

Time Frame: Elara faces the treacherous paths
Elara [walks along] rocky path
Wild creatures [hide behind] dense bushes
Treacherous paths [lead to] Crystal Cavern

Time Frame: Elara meets the Guardian dragon
Crystal Cavern entrance [glows with] shimmering light
Guardian dragon [sits atop] crystal throne
Elara [stands before] Guardian dragon

After get the time frame, generate a list that map all the relations in the time frames in to the spatial relation categories to help creating game level: "above", "below", "at the right of", "at the left of", and "on top of".
Please show the mapping in the form: relation-mapped result
